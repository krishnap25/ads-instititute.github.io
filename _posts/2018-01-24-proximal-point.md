Introduction
============

The proximal point method is a conceptually simple algorithm for
minimizing a function $$f$$ on $${\mathbb R}^d$$. Given an iterate $$x_t$$,
the method defines $$x_{t+1}$$ to be any minimizer of the proximal
subproblem

$$
\underset{x}{\operatorname{argmin}}~\left\{f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2\nu}\|x-x_t\|^2\right\},
$$ 

for an appropriately chosen parameter $$\nu>0$$. At first glance, each proximal
subproblem seems no easier than minimizing $$f$$ in the first place. On
the contrary, the addition of the quadratic penalty term often
regularizes the proximal subproblems and makes them well conditioned.
Case in point, the subproblem may become convex despite $$f$$ not being
convex; and even if $$f$$ were convex, the subproblem has a larger strong
convexity parameter thereby facilitating faster numerical methods.

Despite the improved conditioning, each proximal subproblem still
requires invoking an iterative solver. For this reason, the proximal
point method has predominantly been thought of as a
theoretical/conceptual algorithm, only guiding algorithm design and
analysis rather than being implemented directly. One good example is the
proximal bundle method (Lemarechal, Strodiot, and Bihain 1981), which
approximates each proximal subproblem by a cutting plane model. In the
past few years, this viewpoint has undergone a major revision. In a
variety of circumstances, the proximal point method (or a close variant)
with a judicious choice of the control parameter $$\nu>0$$ and an
appropriate iterative method for the subproblems can lead to practical
and theoretically sound numerical methods. In this blog, I will briefly
describe three recent examples of this trend:

Each epsiode, discussing the examples above, is self-contained and can
be read independently of the others. A version of this blog series will
appear in SIAG/OPT Views and News 2018.

<a name="notation"></a>Notation
========

The following two constructions will play a basic role in the blog. For
any closed function $$f$$ on $${\mathbb R}^d$$, the *Moreau envelope* and
the *proximal map* are 

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_{\nu}(z)&:=\inf_{x}~\left\{f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2\nu}\|x-z\|^2\right\},\\
{\rm prox}_{\nu f}(z)&:=\underset{x}{\operatorname{argmin}}~\left\{f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2\nu}\|x-z\|^2\right\},
\end{aligned}
$$

respectively. In this notation, the proximal point method is simply the
fixed-point recurrence on the proximal map:[^2]

$$
{\bf Step\, }t: \qquad \textrm{choose }x_{t+1}\in {\rm prox}_{\nu f}(x_t).
$$

Clearly, in order to have any hope of solving the proximal subproblems,
one must ensure that they are convex. Consequently, the class of weakly
convex functions forms the natural setting for the proximal point
method.

 A function $$f$$ is called *$$\rho$$-weakly convex* if the assignment
$$x\mapsto f(x)+\frac{\rho}{2}\|x\|^2$$ is a convex function.

For example, a $$C^1$$-smooth function with $$\rho$$-Lipschitz gradient is
$$\rho$$-weakly convex, while a $$C^2$$-smooth function $$f$$ is $$\rho$$-weakly
convex precisely when the minimal eigenvalue of its Hessian is uniformly
bounded below by $$-\rho$$. In essence, weak convexity precludes functions
that have downward kinks. For instance, $$f(x):=-\|x\|$$ is not weakly
convex since no addition of a quadratic makes the resulting function
convex.

Whenever $$f$$ is $$\rho$$-weakly convex and the proximal parameter $$\nu$$
satisfies $$\nu<\rho^{-1}$$, each proximal subproblem is itself convex and
therefore globally tractable. Moreover, in this setting, the Moreau
envelope is $$C^1$$-smooth with the gradient 

$$
\nabla f_{\nu}(x)=\nu^{-1}(x-{\rm prox}_{\nu f}(x)).
$$

Rearranging the
gradient formula yields the useful interpretation of the proximal point
method as gradient descent on the Moreau envelope

$$
x_{t+1}=x_t-\nu\nabla f_{\nu}(x_t).
$$

In summary, the Moreau envelope $$f_{\nu}$$ serves as a $$C^1$$-smooth
approximation of $$f$$ for all small $$\nu$$. Moreover, the two conditions

$$
\|\nabla f_{\nu}(x_{t})\|< \varepsilon
$$ 

and

$$
\|\nu^{-1}(x_t-x_{t+1})\|<\varepsilon,
$$ 

are equivalent for the
proximal point sequence $$\{x_t\}$$. Hence, the step-size
$$\|x_t-x_{t+1}\|$$ of the proximal point method serves as a convenient
termination criteria.

Examples of weakly convex functions
-----------------------------------

Weakly convex functions are widespread in applications and are typically
easy to recognize. One common source of weakly convex functions is the
composite problem class $$\mathcal{C}$$: 

$$
\min_{x}~ F(x):=g(x)+h(c(x)),
$$

where
$$g\colon {\mathbb R}^d\to{\mathbb R}\cup\{+\infty\}$$ is a closed convex
function, $$h\colon{\mathbb R}^m\to{\mathbb R}$$ is convex and
$$L$$-Lipschitz, and $$c\colon{\mathbb R}^d\to{\mathbb R}^m$$ is a
$$C^1$$-smooth map with $$\beta$$-Lipschitz gradient. An easy argument shows
that $$F$$ is $$L\beta$$-weakly convex. This is a worst case estimate. In
concrete circumstances, the composite function $$F$$ may have a much more
favorable weak convexity constant (e.g., phase retrieval (Duchi and Ruan
2017a, Section 3.2)).

1. (Additive composite)
    The most prevalent example is additive composite minimization. In this
    case, the map $$c$$ maps to the real line and $$h$$ is the identity
    function: 

    $$
    \label{eqn:add_comp}
    \min_{x}~ c(x)+g(x).
    $$ 
            
    Such problems appear often in statistical
    learning and imaging. A variety of specialized algorithms are available;
    see for example Beck and Teboulle (2012) or Nesterov
    (2013).

2. (Nonlinear least squares)

    The composite problem class also captures nonlinear least squares
    problems with bound constraints: 

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
            \min_x~ \|c(x)\|_2\quad \textrm{subject to}\quad l_i\leq x_i\leq u_i ~\forall i.
    \end{aligned}
    $$ 

    Such problems pervade engineering and scientific
    applications.
3. (Exact penalty formulations)
    Consider a nonlinear optimization
    problem: 

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
            \min_x~ \{f(x): G(x)\in \mathcal{K}\},
    \end{aligned}
    $$ 
            
    where $$f$$ and $$G$$ are smooth maps and
    $$\mathcal{K}$$ is a closed convex cone. An accompanying *penalty
    formulation* -- ubiquitous in nonlinear optimization -- takes the form

    $$
    \min_x~ f(x)+\lambda \cdot {\rm dist}_{\mathcal{K}}(G(x)),
    $$ 

    where
    $${\rm dist}_{\mathcal{K}}(\cdot)$$ is the distance to $$\mathcal{K}$$ in
    some norm. Historically, exact penalty formulations served as the early
    motivation for the composite class $$\mathcal{C}$$.
4. (Robust phase retrieval)
    Phase retrieval is a common computational problem, with applications in
    diverse areas, such as imaging, X-ray crystallography, and speech
    processing. For simplicity, I will focus on the version of the problem
    over the reals. The (real) phase retrieval problem seeks to determine a
    point $$x$$ satisfying the magnitude conditions,

    $$
    |\langle a_i,x\rangle|\approx b_i\quad \textrm{for }i=1,\ldots,m,
    $$

    where $$a_i\in {\mathbb R}^d$$ and $$b_i\in{\mathbb R}$$ are given. Whenever
    there are gross outliers in the measurements $$b_i$$, the following robust
    formulation of the problem is appealing (Eldar and Mendelson 2014; Duchi
    and Ruan 2017a; Davis, Drusvyatskiy, and Paquette 2017):

    $$
    \min_x ~\tfrac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m |\langle a_i,x\rangle^2-b_i^2|.
    $$

    Clearly, this is an instance of the composite class $$\mathcal{C}$$.
    For some recent perspectives on phase retrieval, see the survey (Luke
    2017). There are numerous recent nonconvex approaches to phase
    retrieval, which rely on alternate problem formulations; e.g., (Candès,
    Li, and Soltanolkotabi 2015; Chen and Candès 2017; Sun, Qu, and Wright
    2017).
5. (Robust PCA)
    In robust principal component analysis, one seeks to identify sparse
    corruptions of a low-rank matrix (Candès et al. 2011; Chandrasekaran et
    al. 2011). One typical example is image deconvolution, where the
    low-rank structure models the background of an image while the sparse
    corruption models the foreground. Formally, given a $$m\times n$$ matrix
    $$M$$, the goal is to find a decomposition $$M=L+S$$, where $$L$$ is low-rank
    and $$S$$ is sparse. A common formulation of the problem reads:

    $$
    \min_{U\in {\mathbb R}^{m\times r},V\in {\mathbb R}^{n\times r}}~ \|UV^T-M\|_1,
    $$

    where $$r$$ is the target rank.
6. (Censored $$ \mathbb{Z}_2$$ synchronization)
    A synchronization problem over a graph is to estimate group elements
    $$g_1,\ldots, g_n$$ from pairwise products $$g_ig_j^{-1}$$ over a set of
    edges $$ij\in E$$. For a list of application of such problem see
    (Bandeira, Boumal, and Voroninski 2016; Singer 2011; Abbe et al. 2014),
    and references therein. A simple instance is $$\mathbb{Z}_2$$
    synchronization, corresponding to the group on two elements $$\{-1,+1\}$$.
    The popular problem of detecting communities in a network, within the
    Binary Stochastic Block Model (SBM), can be modeled using $$\mathbb{Z}_2$$
    synchronization.

    Formally, given a partially observed matrix $$M$$, the goal is to recover
    a vector $$\theta\in \{\pm 1\}^d$$, satisfying
    $$M_{ij}\approx \theta_i \theta_j$$ for all $$ij\in E$$. When the entries of
    $$M$$ are corrupted by adversarial sign flips, one can postulate the
    following formulation

    $$
    \min_{\theta\in {\mathbb R}^{d}}~ \|P_{E}(\theta\theta^T-M)\|_1,
    $$

    where the operator $$P_E$$ records the entries indexed by the edge set
    $$E$$. Clearly, this is again an instance of the composite problem class
    $$\mathcal{C}$$.

    suffices to assume that $$f$$ is bounded from below.
